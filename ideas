# ideas for the package

Goal: Create a package where weed scientists can organize an experiment, design it and, analysing it without the need of any other software.

# Tools provided by the package

##Herbicide database##
Create an database with a complete list of herbicides with the follow layout:

Columns: A_I,Trade_name, Company, Conc_%,Form, Conc_US, Conc_INT, Surfactant

## Weed database? ###

Maybe create a weed database with species name, common name etc


## Herbicide treatment list generation ###

If user needs to calculate treatment rates we will provide a function to do it based on a query at the data base:

example: treatments(data = Query_fromDB, type = "DR", n_treat = 9, step = 2, rate = 20 , unit = "US",
                    height = 12, pres = 30)

This should generate a df with the herbicide info, treat_number, rate_US, rate_INT

### Multiple experimental designs ###

The user should provide the desired experimental design and a function will generate the order

example: exp_design(data = experiment_info_df, design = "RCBD", location = "field", reps = 6, blocks = 4,
                    exp_area = 40, units = "US", design_map = TRUE)

### Analysis #####

- connection to drc package
- Pretty plots with ggplot
